# Introduction to CiviCRM

### Aim

After this session, participants should understand a little about the history of CiviCRM, the difference between a CMS and a CRM, what CiviCRM is and be able to navigate basic CiviCRM screens and data.

### Objectives

Understand:

- The history and background of CiviCRM and it's community.
- How and where you can find further information and support
- The potential of CiviCRM (Components, Extensions & Customisations)

- Be familiar with basic user interface elements, record types, and getting around CiviCRM


### Learning points

You should aim to cover the following points in this session:

- About the project
    - History of CiviCRM
    - The release cycle
- The community
    - users, service providers, partners
    - website, meetups and conferences
    - Help, Documentation, StackExchange, Jira, Make It Happen
- User interface
    - Contacts
    - Finding contacts
    - Advanced search
    - Actions

### Session plan

You should allow 60mins for this session.

Depending on how advanced the class is, explaining how to navigate the user interface may last less time than noted. In this case, there are plenty of more challenging / exploratory exercises that students can do in the handout. Also, you might want to chat with students when they have finished exercises about existing implementations / needs.

### Preparation

Find an appropriate contact in the database that can be used to illustrate what contacts look like (one with groups, tags, memberships, events, etc.).

Open some tabs that illustrate various places that people can / should go to ask for help and find out more, e.g.

- home page
- professional services
- stack exchange
- bug and issue tracker
- documentation
- meet ups / events pages

## Introduction

Outline that in this session, we'll talk about the following things

- quick introduction to the CiviCRM project
- some information about the CiviCRM community and where you can get help
- an introduction to the user interface, basic record types, and some getting around

Mention that if you have used CiviCRM before, you might find this a bit slow, but actually, you should pay attention because you might have missed something 'obvious' until now.

### About CiviCRM (5)

Some key points to get across and expand upon.

- The CiviCRM project started in 2004 with the aim of creating a freely available CRM built from the ground up for non profits.
- Today CiviCRM has a wealth of functionality that can be used 'out of the box' (and this training course aims to show you how to use that functionality).
- CiviCRM is modular - consists of different components and extensions that can be turned on and off

### The CiviCRM community (10)

Ask learners how they are getting support for their CiviCRM. If the following examples don't come up, it is probably worth mentioning them.

- working with outside consultants / agency for development and support
- internal technical team who are supporting CiviCRM
- using a turnkey CiviCRM provider for hosting
- learning as you go and getting support on stack exchange

Show learners the CiviCRM website and stack exchange and encourage them to post questions online and make use of stack exchange.

Explain that CiviCRM is not like a lot of software that people might be used to, that you 'buy in a shop' - instead it is freely available to download.

Explain what open source means in the CiviCRM context.
- Free to download, not free to write - lots of the code contributions (and other contributions like conferences, trainings, etc.) come from service providers who make the work freely available once written
- Set up by people who saw an overlap between non profit aims and open source culture
- a wide ecosystem of developers. co-ordinated but definitley not one company - choosing civicrm does not guaruntee sucess in your project!
- lots of people have full time paid jobs developing CiviCRM
- lots of other day to day software is open source (firefox, android, etc.).

At this point it is also worthwhile mentioning any events that have been happening locally and any events that are coming up.

### The user interface (5)

Point out the following parts of the user interface, and show them in action

**LOG IN!** (this one is important).

- Home page and dashboard
- Quick search for a contact
- Show a contact and the following tabs
    - activities
    - relationships
    - tags and groups
- Menu
- Help bubbles (e.g. membership dashboard)
- Messages
- Search and actions (advanced search - search for student members)

### CiviCRM basics (20 minutes)

Explain that you'll now be talking in detail about some of the basic CiviCRM components that you just saw on the screen.

- contacts
- activities
- relationships
- tags and groups

Don't go into the details of how these can be configured or extended at the moment (we'll cover that in Organising data). At the moment, we just want people to see that they exist.

#### Contacts

Show a contact screen and talk through the summary tab.

Also show people how you can create a new

- individual
- household
- contact

It's important for people to realise that individuals, households and organistions are all grouped together into contacts. i.e. contacts aren't just individuals. You can illustrate this by brainstorming times that it would be useful to see them in the same list, i.e. get the emails of all contacts that we have in a particular city so we can email them (regardless of whether they are organisations or individuals), but some times when you want to see them separatey, e.g., 'show me all the organisations that provide human rights advice'.

#### Activities

Show that from the contact screen, you can add an activity with this contact and that once you filled this in, it will appear on the activities tab.

#### Relationships

Show the relationships tab and explain that relationships are a good way to join two contacts together in CiviCRM

#### Groups and tags

A good way to introduce groups tags by comparing them to relationships: 'While relationships are good for connecting two contacts together, what about when you want to connect 200 contacts together'?

Explain that groups and tags are one of the main ways of segmenting contacts in CiviCRM and ask people why they might want to segment contacts.

People tend to get quite hung up on the difference between groups and tags. Tell people that we'll go more into the differences between them in the 'Organising data' session.

### Exercises (20)

Learners should now complete the exercises so they are familiar with getting around CiviCRM.

# Preparation for courses

Below are some general pointers and things to remember when running a course.

## Day 1 intro

- Icebreakers. Some ideas:
    - Get attendees to interview each other in pairs. Tell them they'll report back to the group on their partner. They should report back on their name, organisation, what they do there, how they are using CiviCRM, and what they want out of the training.
    - Get everyone to introduce themselves - name, organisation, one thing they are finding challenging, and one thing they are excited about.
- Structure of training
    - 5 sessions each day - each is 1 hour long
    - 1 hour of extra time at the end of the day
    - Sessions format is generally presentations and discussion, followed by exercises, followed by recap of the session
    - Tell them you will be starting with the basics, and get more advanced later on
    - Ask if any learners want to do a presentation at some point on how they are using CiviCRM. Having one of these on each day is great.
- Exercises
    - People might not have time to do all of the exercises - encourage them to use the handout to have a go at a later date
    - Ask them to give any feedback they have on the exercises.
- Questions
    - Encourage people to ask questions at any point
    - Remind them also to respect everyone's time - it may be a diverse group, and you don't want a long series of questions on a very specific use case.
- Usernames and passwords, etc.
    - Wifi user name and password
    - Training site username and password

## Day 1 round up

- Recap and briefly discuss what has been covered during the day
- Ask people to think about their choice of sessions (if applicable) for day 2
